# Individual-exercise---QA-Account

I created my Java application on the Ecipse IDE. This is becuase it is open source. 
IntelliJ IDE would be a better choice however due to availability this was not possible.
Intially I planned to build my application using JavaEE. However, due to multiple crashes I switched to SpringBoot. 
When comparing both technoloiges, I would definately prefer SpringBoot because of its flexibility. For example, it allows me to
inject all the necessary features effectively and configure beans in various ways (annotations, xml). 
For frond end design, I used angular js. This is becauase I found it very user freindly. 
For example, it provide mulitple tempaltes to select from when building the front end.
